      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Oren Evans. I'm a new media student at UNC Asheville. I'm also a self taught digital artist. This website showcases a number of finished art peices that I've made over the last few years, as well as my meager web dev skills. 
      Below is my favorite bread recipe. It's a quick and easy crusty white loaf that doesn't require kneading or a starter. Be carful with the ratios, and use a scale if possible for best results. Borrowed without permission from the lovely people at King Aurthor Baking Company, and edited slightly aesthetic purposes.

     Ingredients:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>7 1/2 cups or 900g of all purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 cups or 680g water, lukewarm</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon or 18g salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons or 14g instant yeast or active dry yeast</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
      Intructions:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, or a large (6-quart), food-safe plastic bucket. For first-timers, "lukewarm" means about 105°F, but don't stress over getting the temperatures exact here. 
      Comfortably warm is fine; "OUCH, that's hot!" is not. Yeast is a living thing; treat it nicely.
     </p>
     <p> 
      2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix and stir everything together to make a rough dough. If you have a stand mixer, beat at medium speed with the beater blade for 30 to 60 seconds. 
      If you don't have a mixer, just stir with a spoon or dough whisk until everything is combined.</p>
      <p>
         3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, you're going to let the dough rise. If you've made the dough in a plastic bucket, you're all set — just let it stay there, covering the bucket with a lid or plastic wrap; a shower cap actually works well here. 
        If you've made the dough in a bowl that's not at least 6-quart capacity, transfer it to a large bowl; it's going to rise a lot. There's no need to grease the bowl, though you can if you like; it makes it a bit easier to get the dough out when it's time to bake bread.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cover the bowl or bucket, and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours, or for up to about 7 days. (If you're pressed for time, skip the room-temperature rise, and stick it right into the fridge). 
        The longer you keep it in the fridge, the tangier it'll get; if you chill it for 7 days, it will taste like sourdough. Over the course of the first day or so, it'll rise, then fall. That's OK; that's what it's supposed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you're ready to make bread, sprinkle the top of the dough with flour; this will make it easier to grab a piece. Grease your hands, and pull off about 1/4 to 1/3 of the dough — a 400g to 540g piece, if you have a scale. 
        It'll be about the size of a softball, or a large grapefruit.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shape and place the loaf on a piece of parchment (if you're going to use a baking stone); or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Sift a light coating of flour over the top; this will help keep the bread moist as it rests before baking. 
        Drape the bread with greased plastic wrap, or cover it with a reusable cover.
      </p>
      <P>
        7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the loaf warm to room temperature and rise; this should take about 60 minutes (or longer, up to a couple of hours, if your house is cool). It won't appear to rise upwards that much; rather, it'll seem to settle and expand. Preheat your oven to 450°F while the loaf rests. If you're using a baking stone, position it on a middle rack while the oven preheats.
        Place a shallow metal or cast iron pan on the lowest oven rack, and have 1 cup of hot water ready to go.
      </P>
      <P>
         8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Score lightly with a knife and place the bread in the oven — onto the baking stone, if you're using one, or simply onto a middle rack, if it's on a pan — and carefully pour the 1 cup hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. It'll bubble and steam; close the oven door quickly.
      </P>
      <p>
         9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bake the bread for 25 to 35 minutes, until it's a deep, golden brown. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool.
      </p>
      <p>
         10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You now have a loaf of bread. :] What you do with it is up to you.
